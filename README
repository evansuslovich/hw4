Week 4: Image Processing

Priya Aggarwal & Evan Suslovich


SCRIPT:

The image “art.ppm” and all the variations were created by Evan
and has been authorized for its use for this project.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Input each separate line into the command terminal of IntelliJ.
Some of them are purposely made not be logically correct and
should output a reason why that command did not work to show
how our program handles errors. For example, the first command
is to save an image that has never been uploaded.

save ./src/Pictures/panda.ppm panda
turn-red panda panda-red
load ./src/Pictures/art.ppm art
turn-red art art-red
turn-green art art-green
turn-blue art-green art-green-blue
value-component art art-value
horizontal-flip art-value art-value-fliph
vertical-flip art-value-fliph art-value-fliph-flipv
save ./src/Pictures/art-red.ppm art-red
save ./src/Pictures/art-green-blue.ppm art-green-blue
save ./src/Pictures/art-value-fliph-flipv.ppm art-value-fliph-flipv

Main:

    - Purpose:
      Allows users of our program to run our ImageProcessing project.

Controller:

     - Purpose:
     Allows the user to input commands into the terminal with feedback

        -ControllerInterface:
            -contains the processImage function


        -ControllerImpl:
            -implements the processImage from the ControllerInterface.
            -handles all inputs from the user

Model:
    - Purpose:
    All the functionality of this program: storing the image and imageName, manipulating images,
    Pixel class which is the RGB value object, PPMImage is the class for PPM image


    More Specific Functionality/Purpose:

    -ImageInterface
        -ImageInterface holds all the functions required for this assignment
        -convertToString() returns a StringBuilder containing the String equivalent of the PPM
    -ImageModel
        -Contains the listOfImages along with functions to add and remove images
    -Pixel
        -An object that holds the red, green, blue values.
        -All manipulation of images goes down to the pixel level
    -PPMImage
        -Object for the PPM image
        -reads the PPM, implements all methods in the ImageInterface, and helpers

View:
    - Purpose:
    Allows the user to receive feedback on how their commands have been recieved by the program

    - SimpleViewInterface
        - An interface to hold all potential views when the view becomes more complicated and
          there is more variation
    - SimpleView
        - Implements the SimpleViewInterface
        - Contains an appendable that the controller outputs messages to
